							<p class="text-center">Increased</p>
							<p>The energy efficiency in transport is the useful travelled distance, of passengers, goods or any type of load; divided by the total energy put into the transport propulsion means. The energy input might be rendered in several different types depending on the type of propulsion, and normally such energy is presented in liquid fuels, electrical energy or food energy. The energy efficiency is also occasionally known as energy intensity. The inverse of the energy efficiency in transport, is the energy consumption in transport.</p>

							<h1 class="text-center">ELECTRIFICATION IN TRANSPORT</h1>
							<p class="text-center">Highly Incentivized</p>
							<p>While more all-electric vehicles (EVs) are now hitting the personal vehicle market, the growth is also surging in trucks, buses, and industrial/agricultural vehicles. Companies like Amazon have announced plans to purchase thousands of electric delivery trucks, with the intention to move to an all-electric fleet in the next few years. The US Postal Service is also planning a fleet of thousands of EVs. Even truck manufacturers are rolling out long-haul electric trucks that will change the face of interstate commerce. While electric buses and trains have been in service for decades now, electrification is moving into new areas ranging from agricultural equipment to scooters. We are also witnessing EV technology moving into electrified aircraft, enabled by a new generation of powerful, lightweight electric motors. <br>

                                The rapid surge in the growth of e-retail, driven in large part by the current pandemic, has sparked a critical need for more delivery vehicles of all types, from large delivery vans, to electric delivery bikes for first and last mile pickup and delivery. This is rapidly changing the face of logistics and appears to be the “new normal” going forward.

							<h1 class="text-center">ENERGY EFFIENCY IN BUILDING AND INDUSTRY</h1>
							<p class="text-center">Increased</p>
							<p>The buildings sector accounts for about 76% of electricity use and 40% of all U. S.
                                primary energy use and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, making it
                                essential to reduce energy consumption in buildings in order to meet national energy
                                and environmental challenges (Chapter 1) and to reduce costs to building owners
                                and tenants. Opportunities for improved efficiency are enormous. By 2030, building
                                energy use could be cut more than 20% using technologies known to be cost effective
                                today and by more than 35% if research goals are met. Much higher savings are
                                technically possible.
                                Building efficiency must be considered as improving the performance of a complex
                                system designed to provide occupants with a comfortable, safe, and attractive living
                                and work environment. This requires superior architecture and engineering designs,
                                quality construction practices, and intelligent operation of the structures. Increasingly,
                                operations will include integration with sophisticated electric utility grids.
                                The major areas of energy consumption in buildings are heating, ventilation, and
                                air conditioning—35% of total building energy; lighting—11%; major appliances
                                (water heating, refrigerators and freezers, dryers)—18% with the remaining 36% in
                                miscellaneous areas including electronics. In each case there are opportunities both
                                for improving the performance of system components (e.g., improving the efficiency
                                of lighting devices) and improving the way they are controlled as a part of integrated
                                building systems (e.g., sensors that adjust light levels to occupancy and daylight)

							<p class="text-center">Incentivized</p>
							<p>Heat pumps are the big one. Building electrification is an attractive alternative today because fossil-powered appliances and equipment already have viable electric substitutes. It's just a matter of making — and paying for — the switch. <br>

                                Heat pumps are the enabling technology of widespread building electrification. Unlike conventional furnaces or boilers, which burn fuels to produce heat, heat pumps use electricity to send heat where it’s needed or remove it from where it’s not, much like a refrigerator. And because heat pumps can either expel heat from the indoors during the cooling season or capture heat outdoors from the ground or air and draw it indoors in winter, they offer a two-for-one benefit: heating and air-conditioning from the same equipment.<br>
                                
                                In a fully electrified home or office, furnaces and boilers that today run on natural gas, propane or heating oil can be replaced with ground- or air-source heat pumps. Gas-powered water heaters can be replaced with heat pump water heaters. And in the kitchen, gas-powered ovens and burners can be replaced with electric ranges and induction cooktops.
