							<h1 class="text-center">DEFORESTATION</h1>
							<p class="text-center">Highly Reduced</p>
							<p>Deforestation is the permanent removal of trees to make room for something besides forest. This can include clearing the land for agriculture or grazing, or using the timber for fuel, construction or manufacturing. 
								<br>
									Forests cover more than 30% of the Earth's land surface, according to the World Wildlife Fund. These forested areas can provide food, medicine and fuel for more than a billion people. Worldwide, forests provide 13.4 million people with jobs in the forest sector, and another 41 million people have jobs related to forests. 
								<br>
									Forests are a resource, but they are also large, undeveloped swaths of land that can be converted for purposes such as agriculture and grazing. In North America, about half the forests in the eastern part of the continent were cut down for timber and farming between the 1600s and late 1800s, according to National Geographic.</p>

							<h1 class="text-center">METHANE AND OTHER</h1>
							<p class="text-center">Highly Reduced</p>
							<p>Cutting methane emissions is the fastest opportunity we have to immediately slow the rate of global warming, even as we decarbonize our energy systems.
								<br>
								It’s an opportunity we can’t afford to miss.
								<br>
								Methane has more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide over the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere. Even though CO2 has a longer-lasting effect, methane sets the pace for warming in the near term.
								<br>
								At least 25% of today’s warming is driven by methane from human actions. One of the largest methane sources is the oil and gas industry. 
								<br>
								For many years, methane was overlooked in the climate conversation. But scientists and policymakers are increasingly recognizing that methane reductions are crucial.
								<br>
								Slowing today’s unprecedented rate of warming can help avert our most acute climate risks, including crop loss, wildfires, extreme weather and rising sea levels.
								<br>
								Atmospheric concentration of methane is increasing faster now than at any time since the 1980s.
								<br>
								Which means that now is the methane moment: Acting now to reduce methane emissions will have immediate benefits to the climate that reductions in carbon dioxide cannot provide on their own.

							<h1 class="text-center">AFFORESTATION</h1>
							<p class="text-center">High Growth</p>
							<p>Afforestation is the process of introducing trees and tree seedlings to an area that has previously not been forested. Afforestation can be done through tree planting and seeding, naturally or artificially.
							<br>
								Similarly, reforestation can be considered a form of afforestation. Reforestation is the alteration of a non-forested area to a forested area through tree planting and seeding. The difference is that reforestation is the restoration of an area that has been deforested.
								<br>
								Afforestation, reforestation and other forms of conservational forestry methods are often thought to be used for stopping the effects of climate change by reducing atmospheric carbon. The issue is which type of tree sequesters the most amount of carbon and does this have a positive or negative effect if any at all? The tree types that are widely discussed are old growth vs young-growth forests. Old growth forests are said to have massive carbon storage capabilities however these trees are capturing carbon incredibly slowly or unable to capture any more. With reforestation, this process is ‘solved’ by cutting down old growth and planting young-growth trees. Unfortunately, when an old growth forest is cut down, a lot of the stored carbon gets released into the atmosphere thus preventing a net positive effect. Afforestation is being thought of as a solution to the reforestation issue. By planting a new young-growth forest in an area that hasn’t previously had a forested, this could be a viable option for sequestering more carbon from the atmosphere. However, planting trees in an area previously unforested could impact the original ecosystem negatively such as reducing soil moisture in an area and forcing many species to leave their preferred habitats.

							<h1 class="text-center">TECHNOLOGICAL</h1>
							<p class="text-center">Low Growth</p>
							<p>Several emerging technologies offer the prospect of removing CO2 from the atmosphere at a large scale in the United States. These technologies will require significant and sustained policy investments in continued technological development, enabling infra­structure and markets, and scientific understanding of net climate benefits and ancillary effects. Developing capa­bilities for large-scale technological carbon removal may prove critical for stabilizing global temperatures, given the overall apparent need for carbon removal and limitations on land management approaches to carbon removal.
								<br>
								BECCS can take many forms—in several different sectors with several different biomass feedstocks. The net climate benefits and ancillary effects of these forms vary widely. Some forms of BECCS could be detrimental for food security and natural ecosystems. Some forms provide emissions reduction but not carbon removal. Some forms may not provide climate benefits at all, given direct and indirect land use change and other accounting issues. Appropriate safeguards and proper accounting would be needed to ensure that the deploy­ment of BECCS is beneficial. These safeguards would inevitably limit the potential scale of carbon removal achievable with BECCS.
								<br>
								Developing capabilities for deploying BECCS at a large scale principally entails driving down the cost of CCS technology, building out CO2 transport infrastructure and storage operations, and resolv­ing persistent uncertainties related to net climate benefits and ancillary effects. Deploying beneficial forms of BECCS at scale would also require developing supply chains for feedstock derived from sources other than dedicated energy crops, such as forest byproducts, agricultural residues, and municipal waste.
								<br>
								There is no obvious way to bound the technical potential of DACS. Its economic potential is cur­rently limited by high costs and intensive require­ments for low-carbon energy inputs. But costs appear to be lower than previously estimated, and contin­ued technological development could further reduce them. Geological storage capacity in the United States appears to be sufficiently large, although sites must be individually validated.
								<br>
								Developing capabilities for deploying DACS at a large scale principally entails driving down the cost of the technology and building out CO2 stor­age operations. Markets for CO2 utilization products could also help support early-stage deployment for DACS systems. Additionally, because DACS requires a significant amount of low-carbon heat and power, the prospect of its deployment at scale in the United States could have impli­cations for the desired composition of the U.S. energy sector in the coming decades.
