							<p>How will our continuously growing population affect our way of life, our planet, our environment? No matter how you look at it, we have a big problem
                            <br>
                                At the rate we’re going, we are already using up the available resources of 1 ½ Earths, even though this planet is all we have at the moment. Unless we can find another Earth where we can move half of our 7 billion population, it’s very obvious that we are using up our finite supply of resources. The effect of growing population will be an increased demand for resources and space. Both of which we are running out of. The Earth just can’t keep up with us and our habit of wastage is not helping.
                            <br>
                            Some scientists believe that our advances in Science will help augment the demands of a growing population. They don’t believe that further population growth should be a cause of concern. 
                            <br>
                            By year 2025, we should be reaching a population between 8 to 10 billion. By year 2100, we will need 3 Earths to continue living the way we do. Where do we find the other 2 Earths?
                            <br>
                            Is the concern real? That’s up to you to decide. The evidence is everywhere.

							<h1 class="text-center">ECONOMIC GROWTH</h1>
							<p class="text-center">STATUS QUO</p>
							<p>Economic growth, the process by which a nation’s wealth increases over time. Although the term is often used in discussions of short-term economic performance, in the context of economic theory it generally refers to an increase in wealth over an extended period.
                                <br>

                                Growth can best be described as a process of transformation. Whether one examines an economy that is already modern and industrialized or an economy at an earlier stage of development, one finds that the process of growth is uneven and unbalanced. Economic historians have attempted to develop a theory of stages through which each economy must pass as it grows. Early writers, given to metaphor, often stressed the resemblance between the evolutionary character of economic development and human life—e.g., growth, maturity, and decadence. Later writers, such as the Australian economist Colin Clark, have stressed the dominance of different sectors of an economy at different stages of its development and modernization. For Clark, development is a process of successive domination by primary (agriculture), secondary (manufacturing), and tertiary (trade and service) production. For the American economist W.W. Rostow, growth proceeds from a traditional society to a transitional one (in which the foundations for growth are developed), to the “take-off” society (in which development accelerates), to the mature society. Various theories have been advanced to explain the movement from one stage to the next. Entrepreneurship and investment are the two factors most often singled out as critical.
