## 🌟 Our Motto

### "Pledge 2 be Cool and make Earth 2&#176; Cooler"

## 🌟 Introduction

#### "Earth provides enough to satisfy every man's need but not every man's greed."

* __Global warming__ is the increase of average world temperature as a result of what is known as the __greenhouse effect__. Certain __gases__ in the __atmosphere__ act like glass in a greenhouse, allowing sunlight through to __heat the earth__'s surface but trapping the heat as it radiates back into space.
* It's being __predicted__ that by the next century __Earth__ will see a rise of nearly __5&#176;C__ in the global __temperature__ due to __Global warming__.
* __Team 2&#176;__ believes this rise in temperature can be __restrained__ to __2&#176;C__ and aims to make it a __reality__ with this project .

## 🌟 Problem Statement

* __What is Global warming?__

  * Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth's climate system observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere.

* __What causes Global warning?__

    * It is caused by increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mainly from human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, industrial activities and farming.

* __How big is the Global Warming?__

    * Climate change is already happening: temperatures are rising, drought and wild fires are starting to occur more frequently, rainfall patterns are shifting, glaciers and snow are melting and the global mean sea level is rising.


##  🌟 Problem Solution

* __Project 2&#176;__ has __simulated__ to design the most __opitimal scenario__ to restrain the rise in global temperature due to global warming.
* In this Project __Team 2&#176;__ took into consideration __factors__ such as:
 
     * __Energy Supply__  
     * __Transport__
     * __Buildings and Industry__
     * __Population Growth__
     * __Economic Growth__
     * __Land and Industrial Emissions__
     * __Carbon Removal__

     along with various __sub-factors__ such as:

     * __Use of Coal__
     * __Renewable Resources__
     * __New Zero Concept__
     * __Carbon Price__
     * __Energy Efficiency__
     * __Afforestation__
     * __Use of Technology for Carbon Removal__ , etc.
 
* __Team 2&#176;__ has also given insights about existing green technologies such as:
 
     * __FuelGems__
     * __Climeworks__
     * __Terramera__
     * __CarbonCure__
 
  which are working efficiently towards __Net-Zero Carbon__ , __Carbon Neutrality__ or simply __Carbon Removal__.

* __Team 2&#176;__ has used [En-ROADS](https://en-roads.climateinteractive.org/scenario.html?v=21.8.0) to simulate the __optimal solution__ which is __practical__ and __achievable__. En-ROADS is a __transparent simulator__ developed by Climate Interactive, Ventana Systems, and __MIT__ Sloan and has been __calibrated against__ a wide range of existing __integrated__ assessment, __climate and energy models__.


* We also have a User Dashboard which can be accessed on authentication (Firebase Google Auth) which is user personalized and it also has a Green Chat feature.
 
* Green Chat is a Exclusive Feature where users can discuss with each other various solution to the problem and come up with the next big change to help us make this initiative a great success.
